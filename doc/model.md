This document is a high-level description of the model used in PhET's _Models of the Hydrogen Atom_ simulation.

## Terminology

* electron state
* electron energy level
* spontaneous emission
* stimulated emission
* absorption
* orbital
* shell
* subshell
* zoomed-in box

## Symbols

These symbols appear in the user interface:

* n
* (n,l,m)
* s,p,d,f,g,h
* x,z

TODO: Mention the simplification that wavelengths are integer values.

TODO: Position and distance are unitless.
